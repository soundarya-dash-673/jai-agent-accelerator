## Product: Jai's Agent Accelerator

### Product Name
Jai's Agent Accelerator

### Tagline (Short Description)
From prototype to production in 48 hours. The framework for building AI agents that actually work.

### Long Description

**Stop building AI demos that break in production.**

You've seen the Twitter threads. You've taken the courses. You've even built a few ChatGPT wrappers.

But when it's time to ship something real? Something that handles edge cases, scales with users, and doesn't hallucinate your company into a lawsuit?

You're stuck.

---

**Jai's Agent Accelerator is different.**

This is the exact framework I use to prototype and productionize every AI agent I build. Battle-tested across hundreds of deployments. Refined through 2 years of teaching non-technical people to ship AI that works.

**What you get:**

**Complete Source Code (MIT Licensed)**
- Production-ready Python backend (FastAPI + LangChain)
- React frontend with streaming chat
- 15+ domain-specific tools
- Deployment configs for Netlify, Docker, Railway

**Masterful Documentation**
- Step-by-step deployment guides
- Customization walkthroughs
- Mixture of Experts methodology explained
- Best practices from real production systems

**The Framework**
- Domain decomposition patterns
- Tool-augmented agent architecture
- Human-in-the-loop workflows
- Eval-driven development approach

---

**Standing on the Shoulders of Giants**

This framework is semantically grounded in the work of:
- Geoffrey Moore (Crossing the Chasm)
- Clay Christensen (Jobs to Be Done)
- April Dunford (Obviously Awesome)
- Marty Cagan (Inspired)
- Ash Maurya (Running Lean)
- Eric Ries (The Lean Startup)
- swyx (The AI Engineering patterns)
- Harrison Chase (LangChain)
- Anthropic Team (Human-AI collaboration)
- And more...

---

**Who This Is For**

You should buy this if you're:
- A PM building AI features into your product
- A founder who needs AI workflows without a full team
- A developer ready to go beyond ChatGPT wrappers
- A PMM or designer learning to build with AI

You should NOT buy this if you:
- Want someone to build it for you
- Need a no-code solution
- Just want prompts to copy-paste

### Day 3: Getting Started Check-in

**Subject:** How's your agent coming along?

Hi {name},

It's been a few days since you got access to the Agent Accelerator.

Quick check-in:
- Have you gotten the agent running locally?
- Any blockers I can help with?

If you're stuck, reply to this email. I read every message.

**Quick tip:** The fastest path to a working agent:
1. Start with the default PMM agent
2. Make one small change to the prompts
3. Deploy to Netlify (free tier works fine)
4. THEN customize for your domain

Most people try to customize too early. Get it running first.

### Day 14: Case Study Request

**Subject:** Quick question about your agent

Hi {name},

Two weeks in — I'm curious how it's going.

Have you shipped anything yet? Even a prototype counts.

If you've got something working, I'd love to hear about it. The best examples become case studies (with your permission) and help future builders.

Just reply with a few sentences about:
- What you built
- Who it's for
- What made it work (or not)

— Jai

## FAQ (for product page)

**Do I need to know how to code?**
You should be comfortable reading Python and following terminal commands. You don't need to be a senior developer, but this isn't a no-code solution.

**What about OpenAI/GPT-4?**
The template uses Claude, but the patterns work with any model. The architecture is model-agnostic.

**How much does it cost to run?**
Expect $30-50/month in API costs at typical usage. The template includes cost optimization strategies.

**Can I use this commercially?**
Yes. The code is MIT licensed. You can use it for client projects, internal tools, or products you sell.

**Is there a refund policy?**
Yes. 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked.

**What's the difference between tiers?**
Starter = code + docs. Pro = code + docs + video learning + office hours. Team = everything + multiple seats + direct access.

**When does the cohort course start?**
January 27, 2025. The course is sold separately on Maven but includes accelerator access.

## Pricing Psychology Notes

**$497 (Starter):**
- Below $500 threshold (feels more accessible)
- Positions as "serious tool" not "$99 template"
- Comparable to premium Tailwind/SaaS templates

**$997 (Pro):**
- Just under $1,000 psychological barrier
- 2x Starter = clear value upgrade
- Video content justifies price jump

**$1,997 (Team):**
- Standard "3 seats" SaaS team pricing
- 1-hour call = high perceived value
- Slack channel = ongoing relationship

**Anchor effect:** Team price makes Pro look reasonable. Most sales will be Pro tier.

## Product Analysis

### Input Summary
{product_description[:500]}...

### Structured Extraction

**What I understand:**
- Product category and type
- Core problem being solved
- Key features mentioned
- Target audience indicators

**What I need to clarify:**
- Specific ICP definition (company size, role, industry)
- Quantified proof points (benchmarks, case studies)
- Competitive set and differentiation claims
- Current positioning (if any exists)
- Success metrics and goals

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Use `identify_icp` to define target customer precisely
2. Use `extract_value_props` to map features to benefits
3. Use `search_competitors` to understand competitive context

### Existing Materials Analysis

## Value Proposition Extraction

### Target Audience
{target_audience}

### Feature to Benefit Mapping

| Feature | Benefit (So What?) | Value Prop | Proof Point Needed |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|
| [Feature 1] | [Outcome for customer] | [Compelling statement] | [Evidence required] |
| [Feature 2] | [Outcome for customer] | [Compelling statement] | [Evidence required] |
| [Feature 3] | [Outcome for customer] | [Compelling statement] | [Evidence required] |

### Translation Framework Applied
- **Functional Value**: What does it do? (save time, reduce cost, increase output)
- **Emotional Value**: How does it feel? (confidence, peace of mind, pride)
- **Social Value**: What does it signal? (innovation, professionalism, leadership)

### Competitive Differentiation
{competitive_context if competitive_context else "No competitive context provided. Recommend using `search_competitors` to understand differentiation opportunities."}

### Strongest Value Props (Ranked)
1. [Highest impact, most differentiated]
2. [Strong supporting message]
3. [Tertiary message for specific segments]

### Gaps Identified
- Missing proof points for claims
- Unclear differentiation vs. alternatives
- Untested assumptions about customer priorities

### Primary ICP

**Company Characteristics:**
- Industry: [Specific verticals]
- Size: [Employee count / Revenue range]
- Stage: [Startup / Growth / Enterprise]
- Tech Stack: [Relevant technologies]
- Geography: [Regions/countries]

**Buyer Persona:**
- Title: [Decision maker role]
- Department: [Where they sit]
- Seniority: [Level in org]
- Reports to: [Who they answer to]
- KPIs: [What they're measured on]

**Situation Triggers:**
- [Event that creates urgency]
- [Pain point that's acute]
- [Change in circumstances]

### Current Customer Signals
{current_customers if current_customers else "No current customer data provided. Consider customer interviews or survey data."}

### Validation Questions
1. Would they self-identify with this description?
2. Can we reach them through scalable channels?
3. Do they have budget authority?
4. Is the pain point urgent enough to act?

### Next Steps
- Validate ICP with customer interviews
- Cross-reference with closed-won deals
- Test messaging with this segment
